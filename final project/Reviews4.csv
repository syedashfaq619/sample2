Traxemic acid,I am very pleased with Lysteda. My OBGYN prescribed this med for my heavy periods I've been suffering with since I had a tubal ligation in 2007.   I have just completed my first cycle and I pleased to say I FINALLY HAVE A LIGHT TO REGULAR FLOW PERIOD. THANK YOU FOR THIS MED..LIFE SAVER!,10,1
Traxemic acid,I can sleep through the night. No more getting up twice to just let it all out and clean up the mess. No more running to the bathroom every two hours because I'm leaking through. I love this.,10,1
Traxemic acid,My periods were getting worse. To the point I was flooding a super tampon in less than an hour and it was like a tap with clots the size of 50p. I have taken once month last month. 3 days  two tabs 3 times p/d. This month I have to take them but now I am 8 days late on my period. I already have fertility problems and had my left tube taken out 3years ago for the best interest of my health. I am 32 and  had two long term relationships. I've never used contraception with my 2 partners and have never conceived. I am awaiting further diagnosis from my gynaecologist. Just wondering has anyone else's cycle stopped completely taking these tablets?,10,1
Traxemic acid,"I used to have super heavy periods, where even standing up would be an issue (now have bloodstains all around the house from leaking) and I would leak through super plus tampon and super night pad together after just an hour, now my period is 'normal' I wouldn't call it light cause it's still not light I think but it's just normal like other people's periods and I think it is FAB! and I would recommend this to any fellow lady with crazy mental periods because I've not leaked since! wooooo ((however cramps have slightly worsened))",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I love this medication. I bleed super heavy during my cycle. A pad and tampon will last for an hour at most. My doctor wants to do ablation surgery, but I wanted to try the medicine first. It really reduced the bleeding, but my periods went from 9 days to 13.  However, they are light days so I'm happy. For the first 4 months I got a headache with each dose, but now that has gone away.",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I have fibroids and my periods reflects this with large clots, blood pouring into toilet, soaking super size tampon in 25 minutes and severe cramps. Took this medication as prescribed, (2 tablets every 8 hours up to five days) and by dose 3, my period gets manageable. I use Tynol Extra Strength for my cramping pain because Advil is a blood thinner and it works good. I can go 2 hours with a super size tampon now and the extreme heavy bleeding is down to a ""normal"" heavy period. I'd say it reduced bleeding by 40 to 50 %. Instead of 5 or 6 days of bleeding heavy, it's 3 days of "" normal"" heavy and 6 days in total of menstruation. Ladies I recommend giving this a go if you also have severe heavy periods. Mild headache as side effect but it is tummy friendly and I have my life back during my periods.",10,1
Traxemic acid,This medicine is a blessing  I am 43 years old I eat healthy and exercise everyday except weekends. On March 15 2017 I was given the depot shot for my heavy bleeding BIG MISTAKE. From the shot I experience more bleeding and blood clots then I ever experience prior to me taking the shot. My bleeding continued for over 90 days I was admitted to the hospital for low blood and had to have a 4 pints of blood transfusion.  On  July 4 my doctor prescribed Lysteda I did experience some cramping and back pain but after 5 days of taking this medicine 3 times a day my bleeding stop completely now husband and I are much happier people!!,10,1
Traxemic acid,Where has this been all my life?  My cycles were really heavy.  I would use an ultra tampon and have an overnight pad on as well.  I would go to the bathroom every hour.  Now I can go every 3-4 hours.  I don't have to worry about getting up in the middle of the night changing pads.  Now I can move on with life and don't have to worry about going somewhere on cycle days.,10,1
Traxemic acid,"Tranexamic acid stops my heavy bleeding I take it 3 times a day and I  take it only one day and it stops my bleeding otherwise my bleeding never stops not even any birth control pills help.
It stops my bleeding so I am happy to use it.
But take original brand as the 
generic never help me",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I've been on Lysteda for 6 months and it really has saved my sanity. I didn't want to jump the gun with a review as I've had birth control pills work for a month or 2 then suddenly my period would come back as bad, if not worse, and lasted once for 41 days! The bleeding and clotting sending me to the bathroom every 30-45 mins has stopped, no more getting up in the middle of the night or changing the sheets at 4am and I've been very lucky with no side effects. 6 pills a day is a lot but considering the alternative of unstoppable bleeding, I happily take them.  It's not a total miracle, I still have ""heavy"" days those would've been a good day for me in the past.  It's worth it, I'm very happy with it.",10,1
Traxemic acid,Works very well for heavy bleeding during menstrual cycle,10,1
Traxemic acid,"I have 20  large fibroids that have come back after two my surgeries. I have just started taking these tablets and what a huge difference it has made to my life. I can now leave the house and no more flooding. I can sleep though the night without getting up multiple times to change. No more large clots. If you bleed to death every month, get these tablets!",10,1
Traxemic acid,"Lysteda is amazing.  I have menorrhagia caused by adenomyosis.  I have dealt with disablingly heavy periods for nearly 10 years.  I usually take two days off from work and wear diapers for the first two days of my period, waking up several times throughout the night to change.  I also experience debilitating cramps and became severely anemic from the heavy bleeding.  This is my first month on Lysteda.  I just completed my third day of treatment, and this is the first normal period I have had in years - no diapers and no cramping whatsoever!  My flow was so light that I only had to change my pad a few times on the heaviest day, and had no need for tampons.  I highly recommend Lysteda.",10,1
Traxemic acid,Please be sure not to always trust advice given by a general pract. I begun taking the medication as I suffered heavy periods. I have now no periods . I have now severe health problem as my ovaries are effected from the medication . Also causing slowing and muscular problems speech and trouble thinking . Also tiredness most times not wanting to wake up. I am thankfully a mother but I did not think this could effect my chance in the  future for more children.  It completely stopped my periods and ruined my hormone levels. My count is so bad the effects are scary. Cyst have been a major cause of stomach pain and depression .,10,1
Traxemic acid,This is a terrific medication for me. I take it for excessively heavy monthly periods. Normally they are so heavy I can't leave the house for a day or two. This really has helped me to deal with the problem without taking hormones or having to have a hysterectomy. I have had no side effects whatsoever and find it very tolerable.,10,1
Traxemic acid,"This medication is life-changing! I have uterus didelphys (double uterus) so I have an extremely heavy period. I would wear a super tampon and pad at the same time and have to change them every 1-2 hours. Hormonal birth control gave me some not-so-great side effects and interacted with some other medications I was taking, so my gyn suggested this.

Thank god she did! I feel like I’m finally in control of my life again when I’m on my period- it’s light, predictable, and I don’t really have to worry about it. I’ve been using it for several months and I haven’t noticed any side effects.",10,1
Traxemic acid,This medication has been a life saver for me.  I usually bleed so bad that I can't go anywhere when I have my period. I flood the whole time!  My doctor prescribed this for my Disney Trip.  What a lifesaver!  My periods are much lighter and I have no side effects from this medication.  Love it!!,10,1
Traxemic acid,"Tranexamic acid has been a miracle for me, I have PCOS and likely endometriosis as well but am still waiting for a diagnosis on the latter. During my period I have uncontrollable mood swings (which I treat herbally with Chaste Tree- comes as vitex in health shops) and agonizing period cramps, large clots and flooding (I stand up and blood gushes out) this drug has been an absolute miracle. For the first time in 15 years with tranexamic acid I FORGOT that I had my period and it has significantly reduced the pain and amount of blood I lose. Keep in mind I have fainted from pain and low blood pressure in the shower on my period several times. Ladies at least try it, it means that I can go to work and do my uni work and get on with my life. It is the best thing for heavy periods and agonizing pain.  It made me feel a little hyper which was a nice change from praying for death. I'm Australian and its about $40 for a lot of tablets on a Doctors prescription.",10,1
Traxemic acid,First day on this med and I didn't expect it to work as fast as it did. Usually on my first day of my period I bleed so much. But even after taking the first two pills I saw the difference in blood flow. My last two pills for the day still I saw a significant decrease in blood flow. I didn't have any side affects at all my first day and time using this and hope that continues. So far this is the best medication for me and I'm happy.,10,1
Traxemic acid,"Tranexamic-Acid helped stop my irregular menstrual bleeding better than anything else did. In the past the Doctor put me on the pill and then some other medicines, but none of them worked as good as Tranexamic-Acid did at stopping it and controlling it.",10,1
Traxemic acid,I have to share my experience with tranexamic acid for heavy periods that I have had for as long as I can remember.  I would be  bleeding through two boxes of super plus tampons bleeding for 7 days and just horrible cramps sometimes most of the time during my period. I don't even leave the house because it's so heavy this tranexamic acid has been a miracle worker for me it reduce my bleeding up to 50%. I am so happy that I found this and my doctor prescribed that I had no side effects and it's amazing it has truly truly helped me and I am so grateful,10,1
Traxemic acid,My doctor just prescribed this medication for me to use until my surgery. I am to take two 650mg tablets up to 3 times daily as needed. It is to be taken only during my menstrual cycle and not to exceed 5 days. I am always nervous and reluctant to take new medications. Yesterday I took my first dose when I was experiencing an extremely heavy menstrual flow and was getting very faint. I did not expect it to work so quickly! I saw a reduction of blood flow very quickly. I have taken  only two more doses and I am still pleasantly surprised. I have noticed absolutely no side affects. ,10,1
Traxemic acid,"Dr prescribed this for heavy period, clotting due to fibroids. Used to have to change pad (no use for tampon...flow too much) every 45 minutes.

It worked within hours of taking. Now on 3rd month. First 2 cycles were heavy. Third one has been some light spotting and cramping but hardly anything! I haven't taken a single pill in over a month.

Very pleased.",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I used it for the first time....and I have spotting on a pad instead of tons of clotting and lots of bleeding.  I feel better and did not feel it caused headaches and I do get PMS migraines as before.  I would recommend it.  I had a DNC to help with my problem 3 months ago and last month I started clotting and heavy bleeding again.  My doctor told me to try this, as birth control did not do anything positive and made me feel like I am pregnant and gain weight. I am grateful this works as on the heavy bleeding clotting days I would feel emotionally slipping into real depression. I am not depressed but the bleeding seems to bring erratic mood swings. This did help as the doctor said it should. I am not worried about blood clots as I do not smoke.",10,1
Traxemic acid,I started taking this medicine Monday and by Tuesday the bleeding had stopped. I'd got very worried because my period had come 10 days early and was very heavy. The side effects I've got are headaches and diarrhea but a small price to pay to be period free for a while.,10,1
Traxemic acid,"I have had heavy periods for over a year and my doctor kept pushing and ablation. A female colleague of his had a different idea - transexamic acid. I have only used it for one cycle so far and I have my life back! Reduced period at least 60%. I had minor side effects - sudden lower left back pain one day that came and went, a fleeting mild headache and some soft stool. I stopped on day 4 vs day 5 due to the side effects and because the debilitating heavy part of Mybperiod is only 2 days a month. The only thing I have noticed after taking it is that I feel like I do right before my period used to come - heavier ... like I am retaining fluid and my lower abdomen looks bloated. I wonder if that is because the lining of my uterus is heavier.... wondering if I should only take the drug when I am going on vacation and otherwise let my body shed the entire uterine lining?!",10,1
Traxemic acid,I was bleeding very heavy with my periods which severely effected my iron levels... when I started taking these tablet found that it almost stopped the bleeding altogether so I now only take 2 tablets twice a day and works brilliantly for me and my iron levels are back up too with the help of iron tablets.,10,1
Traxemic acid,"Was prescribed this for heavy periods which were seriously affecting my day to day life. Wouldn't even book a holiday. Worked brilliantly-took for first for days of period & it has totally transformed my life. However, in last 6 months have been having painful, swollen joints. Severe knee swelling has been quite debilitating. Also, swollen fingers. I have been on these tablets for 12 months & is only explanation for these ills. (Tested for arthritis, gout & infection-all negative). Am going to speak with doctor about just taking them occasionally e.g. If necessary during holiday. Am going to see if this helps. Would recommend short term.",8,1
Traxemic acid,"I have been taking tranexamic acids for over a year for heavy menstrual bleeding from hemophilia. No side effects other than a very occasional mild headache. The drug works amazingly sometimes, down to almost no bleeding, but then some months it doesn't work at all. So for me, well worth taking for approx half the cycles when it stops the bleeding. Not sure why it's not working the other times.",10,1
Traxemic acid,"Made my life on my period so much easier, without the side effects of birth control.",10,1
Traxemic acid,Worked a lot better then Amicar with less side effects for dental work.,8,1
Traxemic acid,"I suffer from von wilabrant disorder and excessive bleeding during my periods, that can last up to 3 months. I tried this drug. Took 4 pills one set at night and another in the morning. Started having side effects the first night with lower back pains, and then in the morning started having pains in my left thigh and calve. Including swelling and stiffness in my left neck and upper back and a sharp pain in my neck that came and went. Pain in my stomach and numbness my hands and fingers. Dr. Is going to do an ultrasound to look for blood clots.",6,1
Traxemic acid,Have used it before and it works great for my heavy menstrual bleeding,9,1
Traxemic acid,Joint stiffness is worth it.,9,1
Traxemic acid,"I suffered from severe bleeding during period that would last 10 or so days and also intense cramping. (Even the Dr was surprised the severity!). The severe blood loss lead to me being anaemic. 
I was recommended tranexamic acid and it has completely changed my life. It's over halved the amount of blood lost and now my period lasts less than a week (roughly 5 days?). Couldn't survive without this anymore! 
It's also good because it can be used along with over the counter painkillers to help with cramping!",9,1
Traxemic acid,This medication has helped tremendously with my iron deficiency.,9,1
Traxemic acid,"I'm glad my doctor prescribed this medicine to me.  I was having very heavy cycles, to the point I would wear a pair of depends and 2 overnight pads in them.  I would bleed through that and the clothes I was wearing in less than 45 minutes. I have been taking TA for about a year and my cycles are more manageable.",9,1
Traxemic acid,"Used for first time and it was great with slowing down the bleeding (literally shocked at how well) and allowed me the ability to carry on with life.  The bleeding was lighter but still lasted 7 plus days.  One major concern I had was in regard to passing clots.  While normally heavy, I passed two extremely huge (much much larger than normal) clots.  Hoping a result of just first time using.",9,1
Traxemic acid,I am 45 years old and have been suffering disabling heavy periods for about 6 years now. My doctor suggested ablation for my heavy periods but I wanted to try non-surgical remedies first. This medicine is AMAZING. I take 2 pills 3 times a day for 3 days (total of 18 pills). I start on the 2nd day of my period which is the heaviest. My period dries up and is over within 4 days. I have headaches on or off this medicine during my period so I cannot say for sure whether that is a side effect. I have my life back each month.,9,1
Traxemic acid,"I'm 55 years old and hadn't had a period for 9 months then had 3 weeks of bleeding before I went to the doctor and he prescribed this medication 
 It is great!  It has basically stopped my bleeding.  Because of the risks, my Doctor suggested I stop taking it because my bleeding has stopped.  I was on it for (3 days) and he did NOT want me to go over (5) days.",9,1
Traxemic acid,"I have only used it once and I hope it works similarly next month because for the first time in years I have felt 'normal' during my period.  I was able to use regular tampons, practically no bleeding during the night (I usually have to sleep on a towel and get up multiple times).  I usually have a massive blood loss and clots that make me feel like I'm passing my liver out of my body!  I had energy again (I have anaemia due to adenomyosis/blood loss) and was able to actually go out and enjoy life.  I would recommend at least give it a try.  Like others I was unable to use the mirena coil and I was also reluctant to take the pill (hormones/mood swings/bloating).  I found this amazing - and yeah, hoping it continues as well as it did this month :)
Oh, and PS, I was only taking a half dose (I'm a bit of a worrier when it comes to medications) and it made my blood loss very light and very manageable.",9,1
Traxemic acid,"I was prescribed this to reduce my heavy periods, which had been contributing to my aneamia - I had been getting annual iron transfusions for the previous three years. I'm on two three times per day for four days. They work as in, have reduced my bleeding significantly. I have not noticed any side effects during the days I take them. Initially when I took the tablets I would keep spotting for up to 7 days but the last few months my period is all over by day 5. My periods have gone from a 28 day cycle to a 35 day cycle - so I'm assuming this is a side effect. I do get some slight pre period cramping in the 2-3 days before I get my period now, which I have not had previously.
My alternatives to taking this were getting a Mirena implant",9,1
Traxemic acid,"I have been taking tranexamic acid for my heavy periods and it’s honestly changed my life. Gone from leaking through clothes, massive clots, being anxious about the amount of blood loss all the time to a very light flow. I was prescribed mefenamic acid alongside this so with the two together I no longer have to worry about the pain or the heavy flow.",8,1
Traxemic acid,"I was prescribed Tranexamic acid because of my debilitating periods. I am 45 years old and feel like I am 14 just starting my period again. Huge blood clots, heavy flow for 4 to 5 days, just a horrible mess. I admit I was afraid of the side effects, but just after 1 day I feel alright, I feel a bit drowsy but manageable. My flow is less than half of what it used to be. I take 650mg of Motrin every 8 hours with the Transexamic, and it has been a game changer for sure. This was the first option my doctor wanted me to take, second was the IUD and last being surgery. So far I am pretty happy",8,1
Traxemic acid,"Young 30's with super heavy flow including clotting and severe cramps, for years. Gyno recommended tranexamix acid and it works great. I do experience severe cramping with diarrhea but I'm not sitting in a crime scene after putting a pad and a tampon on after 15 minutes on a short car ride, so I'd say it's a win. Hopefully that gets better as my body adjusts.
I am on other medicines for other illnesses including migraines and ulcers so that could be the interactions of the medications but nonetheless, it's an improvement.",8,1
Traxemic acid,"Very heavy period after the birth of my 4th child. Was prescribed this for the heavy bleeding two tablets  3x per day.  I don't even have to take as prescribed. Two  tablets once per day is all I needed, the bad thing is my insurance don't cover this and my doctor suggested a surgery to thin out the lining of my cervix which I am terrified to do. Once I can pay for it out of pocket I will be fine with less bleeding days and light to normal flow with no anemia.",8,1
Traxemic acid,"I've had terrible bleeding and awful pain for periods for a couple of years. This medication has stopped the bleeding , which was so bad I used to pass big clots when I bent over. The pain is still pretty bad, though not as much as before, when it had me rolling around on the floor even after I'd had max doses of paracetamol and ibruprofen at the same time, which also upset my digestive system for a week after my period was over. Misery. So things are a bit better now. My gynaecologist is monitoring things.",8,1
Traxemic acid,"I was bleeding heavy for almost a month using the super pads about 4 or 5 a day. For the first time I went to see my doc and she prescribed me tranexamic acid, it really did work for me. I didn't stop bleeding completely, but it went down to less than a normal flow, and felt more comfortable working out and just living life.

Unfortunately the heavy bleeding has come back, and I've been prescribed more except that my doctor said I can't be taking this every time because I may get blood clots in my legs and other places in my body. She recommended I look into getting a 'mirena'. I've researched it, and unfortunately you cannot become pregnant with it in you. There was no other option given. I am now wanting to see gynecologist. I wish this would go away",8,1
Traxemic acid,"The first time I used this medicine as instructed - 2 pills 3x daily. I was instructed to use for 5 days, but I did not reach day 5 because of the side effects.  This time around, I only used 2 pills on Days 1 & 2 and I definitely have experienced more side effects than I expected  - dizziness and nausea on day 1 and then diarrhea on day 2. However, it is worth it in my opinion. I did pilates today without an issue.... I could never do that with my heavy period (fibroid related)!!! Now I can pop a pill and go out to dinner an hour later without having to worry about wearing white. Huge relief.",8,1
Traxemic acid,I am in my late 40s and was experiencing very very heavy periods. I went to my primary doctor and he immediately suggested the Depo Shot that was the worst mistake I could make I bleed heavy for 3 months and I swore that I was not going back to get the next dose. This med take well over 4 months to get out of your system so the ongoing bleeding caused me Anemia. I had to see a gyno which  was a great decision because she helped me get my iron back to normal and she prescribed me Tranexamic Acid which reduces the bleeding. I am highly satisfied now because my period is now regular and it only last 3 days. I make sure to take all 3 doses for 3 days 650mg it's a lot but it definitely work well for me. I don't experience any side effects and I have been on it for 1 1/2 years. Good luck I hope this info was helpful.,8,1
Traxemic acid,I have been diagnosed with fibroids. I have been bleeding for about 6 weeks now. My previous doctor had me on a hormone called megstrol. I worked for the first month and then stopped. my bleeding is out of control. I am no my 3 day of the lysteda.  I could tell a difference right away. the bleeding slowed to the point of almost stopping. I started to become a little heavy today before I took my first dose. I hope that  this helps with the bleeding and stops it.,7,1
Traxemic acid,My OBG prescribed this because I have heavy bleeding and I would bleed for 2 weeks straight during the day and night. I'm taking iron pills. I'm happy that this medicine reduced my bleeding.  The only side effects I noticed is I had some pimples all over my back neck and face not too much and for the second month I didn't take any pills my period is still  light but it worries me it stopped on the one.,7,1
Traxemic acid,Used this tablet for 3 days for heavy periods 2 tablets 500mg When I stopped on a 3rd day I've experienced extra heavy bleeding with large clots .... I'll give it a go this month for 4 day hoping for some improvements,6,1
Traxemic acid,"I started taking these pills about a year ago. I asked my doctor if she has anything that helps heavy bleeding. She prescribed tranex acid, and for the first couple of months every thing was ok. Six months into taking the meds I started feeling my heart beat racing, it would beat so fast that it would cause me to cough or I would feel my hear beat in my throat. But I didn’t think it was the pills at first, until I skipped a month and that’s when I noticed the rapid heart beats were calming down and stopped. Then the moment I started back taking them is when it started back beating rapid again.",6,1
Traxemic acid,"I was told by my GYN that this was a very effective and safe drug. My periods we're extremely heavy. I would have a flow so heavy in a 24 hour period that most women would experience in 5 to 7 days! So I was desperate. After taking this medicine, I experienced the worst cramping if my life and migraine for 3 days AFTER I was finished. Now I have been spotting one full week after my period which has never happened before. Not for me. Will never use this again.",1,0
Traxemic acid,"I had horrible reactions to this medication which landed me back in the hospital ER twice. Nine days later my body is still struggling to get this drug out of my system. I will never take it again. If you have a reaction to it, there is no reversing it. Use caution.",1,0
Traxemic acid,"I was given this medication as I was prescribed Provera due to hyperplasia, the provera itself have made me bleed heavily for 4 weeks making me anemic so my gyne suggested tranxemic acid 1 3 times a day it's has slowed the bleeding down somewhat but not completely so doctor put me up to 2 3 times a day which I have had to put back down due to severe migraine, runny nose, chest pain and flu symptoms, I don't know what is worse, being on the toilet every half an hour or feeling so run down I can't get off the sofa!",1,0
Traxemic acid,"I have severe Adenomyosis for more than 15 years. My uterus is as big as a 4 month pregnant uterus would be. I am prescribed tranexamic acid because I have extremely heavy menstrual bleeding. I was on Norethindrone for about 56 months and then I received Lupron shot (last resort) before I started Tranexamic Acid because somehow Lupron didn't stop my bleeding even after 4 weeks. 

Tranexamic acid didn't seem to work for me. I was on 6 tablets a day and I usually take it at 8am, 4pm, and 11pm (before going to bed). My bleeding would be lighter during the day but sometime after 5pm I'd start seeing very heavy bleeding with blot clots. It's been going like this for few days and I've been to ER twice and received blood transfusion because I lost too much blood.",1,0
Traxemic acid,"Didn’t work at all for me. Was prescribed for heavy, month and a half long bleeding and it only made it worse. Now I’m soaking through a super plus tampon every hour. It messed up my vision in right eye so bad I thought I was going blind and caused pounding migraines. Waste of time and money.",1,0
Traxemic acid,"I was prescribed this medicine by my OBGyn for heavy menstrual cycles. I was hesitant to take it due to how many you had to take (2 pills 3 times a day). I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone. My body has not been the same since. It did lighten my flow, however, I went to the ER multiple times. I have continued heart palpitations, body aches, chest pain, SOB, horrible headaches, body shivers, numbness in limbs, nausea, dizziness, diarrhea. This medicine has totally messed me up. I stopped over 2 months ago and the symptoms still haven't stopped.",1,0
Traxemic acid,I don't want to take this medicine anymore.  The side effects are killing me.  Headache that is worse than migraine and unexplainable pain in my lower abdomen and hips.  I couldn't go to work because of pain.,2,0
Traxemic acid,"This does not work.  If anything, makes my bleeding worse.  I have suffered with very heavy periods for years, and this does nothing.  My search goes on for something else!",2,0
Traxemic acid,"Went to see my doctors about my extremely heavy periods, and was given pill after pill after pill but nothing seemed to help slow the bleeding down. I have now been on Tranexamic Acid for over 3 months and have experienced a few side effects. Some being more painful aches to joint and muscle pain. I have 2 periods a months and Dr's do not seem to care about the fact it gets so bad it is ruining my clothes, bed sheets and furniture. But theses tablets have made my normal coloured period into a funny black/grey 5 days! With huge blood clots and it seems to be getting worst. I am coming off the pills after this period and thinking of the coil.",3,0
Traxemic acid,"Let me just say last month from the evening of the 1st to the morning of the 3rd I used 50 pads !! A few tampons too ! I started lysteda on the evening of the 1st this month, yes it was lighter !! 28 pads in 2 days. Day 3 and 4 got heavier!! Today I had clotting like I've never seen in my 30 plus years of having a cycle (dollar bill size). The cramps were so bad I felt like I was in labor !! I do suffer from fibriod tumors, and anemia due to heavy bleeding . I'm having a hysterectomy next month, and my Dr wants me to take these pills again next month. I WILL NOT TAKE ANY MORE OF THESE PILLS !! NOT 1 MORE !!",3,0
Traxemic acid,Stopped my bleeding entirely but it wasn’t worth it for the side effects. I felt like my hips and back were about to cave in! Never again!,3,0
Traxemic acid,"I started this medication 3 days ago, I just took the last dose. I don't see that it's helping at all. The bleeding slows down a little during the day but it super heavy when I wake up in the morning. I was cramping before the medicine so I won't say that it's affecting that. I'm not sure I like this medicine. How many days do I need to take it before the bleeding slows completely?",3,0
Traxemic acid,"I’m 18 years old and experience extremely heavy and painful periods, my mother has endometriosis and as it is hereditary worries I may have it too.
My GP prescribed me this as a trial before the pill and during the first 3 days of me taking two 500mg tablets 3x a day, I experienced no change in the amount I was bleeding (in fact I was heavier than I've ever been on a first day) and my cramps were so bad I laid crying on the floor. It made me nauseous and I had a migraine for my whole period. My doctor said this might just be my body getting used to the drug so I tried it again for my next 3 periods and still the same result. My most recent period I decided not to take the tablets and my period was suddenly really watery however it was still heavy and had the pain again. Not sure what I’m going to do now. It works for some but I personally would not recommend",3,0
Traxemic acid,"I started taking this medication about two months ago. I decided to go with this medication because it doesn't mess with hormones and specifically helps with heavy menstrual flow. I started taking it and my flow is so much lighter. The only problem is, my cramps have become unbearable. Before I was on the medication, I never had cramps, just a very heavy flow.",3,0
Traxemic acid,I was prescribed this medicine because of heavy bleeding due to uterine fibroids. I HATE it! It made me feel crap!! I wanted to sleep all day (though I couldn't of course) made me weak and achy. It does slow down the bleeding but it wasn't worth it with the awful side effects.,4,0
Traxemic acid,"I have been using Lysteda for the last six months.  It worked great the first 3 months.  But the fourth month I started having horrible lower back pain, the cramps came back but the flow was still light.  However, the last two months, my cycle came within 2 weeks and I have my cycle again.  According to the dosage and usage, I am unsure if taking it more than 5 days is recommended.  I had my cycle for 5 days, it stopped for 1 day and started back up.  Tried contacting my GYN but couldn't.",4,0
Traxemic acid,"Bleeding heavy after having coil fitted, stopped bleading straight away after  taking first 2 tablets but second day taking tablets got severe itching on neck and chest bit scared to take anymore now",4,0
Traxemic acid,This medication was useless. It was suggested to me by my gyno to help lighten my periods. I took it exactly as prescribed 2 tabs 3x a day. I had absolutely no changes in the flow of my cycle. Very disappointed.,4,0
Traxemic acid,I had two blood transfusion and only had half the amount of blood in my body. Doctor decided to to do an ablation. I’m only 35. I started my cycle for the third time this month before surgery and he prescribed this. I took 6 650 milligrams a day and also prevara daily to stop my bleeding. It never even slowed it!!! I went into surgery on day 7 still bleeding. I am one week post op and so far the ablation has helped. I recently had a blood clot in my arm and how from the iv for surgery I think I have one in my hand. By reading this I should have never been prescribed this since I recently had a blood clot. Seriously this medicine made no difference at all and I also had trouble with my eyes. It’s like they would freeze and I couldn’t focus for a few seconds then would stop. Hasn’t happened since I stopped. I also took this for a week straight and read where you should only take it five days. Don’t waste your time.,2,0
Traxemic acid,Prescribed this for very heavy periods lasting 9 days after already having had an ablation that was not successful. Doctor didn’t want to consider a hysterectomy due to my age (39) so we tried this instead. Dosage was 2 650mg tabs 3x daily. After dose number 2 Ihad shaking and numbness in my hands and was showing potential signs of a stroke so I will not be continuing this drug.,2,0
Traxemic acid,"Horrible. Migraines and severe pelvic pain, with extremely high blood pressure. I was miserable. I recommend with inpatient hospital care inpatient only!!!!",2,0
Traxemic acid,Horrendous. I took it for heavy menstrual bleeding due to fibroids. Although my doctor knew that I am diabetic and have a family history of strokes it was still given to me. I ended up having THREE mini strokes on this bloody drug. I was unaware of the risks. Please educate doctors more about the side effects of this drug. I went through hell.,2,0
Traxemic acid,"I was prescribed this medicine for heavy periods by one of my doctors but wasn't told of the potential risks until another doctor in the same clinic told me that if it's a blood clotting medicine, it could then potentially clot your blood to cause things like stroke, etc.  I was prescribed 6 tablets a day and find that taking only one makes a big difference and my periods manageable to light.  The possible risk still makes me nervous so I take as little as I can to manage my out of control period.",5,1
Traxemic acid,"Last month, my doctor asked me to take TA for a week (2-500g/day) in order to stop my abnormal uterine bleeding. It did relieved my symptom. I am 35 years old and my period has been on a regular 28-day cycle apart from that one episode last month. What concerns me now is that my period has been late for 4 days. It's still too early to tell if it's a side effect of the med I took. All I can do at the moment is to wait for a few more days to be sure before I report back to my doctor. ",5,1
Traxemic acid,I was prescribed this medicine because of heavy bleeding due to uterine fibroids. I HATE it! It made me feel crap!! I wanted to sleep all day (though I couldn't of course) made me weak and achy. It does slow down the bleeding but it wasn't worth it with the awful side effects.,4,0
Lupron,This medicine has given me my life back. I no longer have to stay by a toilet due to extremely heavy periods that left me anemic. I no longer have pain during intercourse due to large fibroids and extremely painful periods. I was put on this medication to shrink fibroids for safer hysterectomy or until menopause kicked in. I am 49 and I have had no side effects since starting this medication.,10,1
Lupron,"I've been on Lupron since March 2015. Just had my 2nd shot. I have to tell you it's taken 100% of my nagging back pain and cramps away. I even lost 12 pounds the first shot. It started to wear out towards the end so I took the shot 2 weeks early. I had surgery May 12th to remove a huge polyp and 2 fibroid tumors  - all benign. I'm having hot flashes and some headaches, some joint pain and that's about it. These symptoms are worth the trade from previous symptoms. I only hope my doctor gives me a hysterectomy soon. She feels Lupron will shrink the fibroids outside my uterus. I'm almost 50 so she says I should hold off on the hysterectomy. I want all this done with. Good luck to all of you.",10,1
Lupron,I took this medication for 6 months due to extreme monthly bleeding caused by fibroids. I didn't have a period or spotting the entire 6 months or for 3 months after my last injection. I did not have even 1 side effect. It was a great experience. Hopefully I will have the same success with the Depo Shot!,10,1
Lupron,"I was diagnosed with a 13cm fibroid.  The doctor wanted to shrink it to be able to perform a lathroscopic hysterectomy.  I was having CONSTANT heavy bleeding for months on end, even the transamic acid wasn't slowing it down.   First drug we tried was Fibristal.  It was supposed to slow the bleeding and shrink the fibroid.  I took this for 6 months and it did ABSOLUTELY nothing.   The doctor then suggested Lupron Depot. The first week on Lupron was hard.  Bleeding was much heavier than before (which was already horrible).  But by week 2 the bleeding completely stopped.  By 5 months on Lupron my fibroid had shrunk to 11cm.  A bit of hot flashes. Some fogginess/irritability, but that's normal for me...lol",10,1
Lupron,"I can't say enough about how glad I am that I was given Lupron injections! I was being treated for heavy non-stop bleeding caused by the several large fibroids I had. I was told by 3 different Doctor's that I would definitely need to have a hysterectomy. I really had no other option. My OBGYN and the surgeon, started me on the Lupron injections 4 months ago to stop the bleeding (I had become extremely anemic and couldn't have the surgery until my blood counts came back up which would take 3 months) and to try and shrink the fibroids. After my 4th and final shot 2 weeks ago, my MRI showed that the fibroids had shrunk 75% and my surgeon discharged me today saying that I will NOT be having a hysterectomy, nor any surgery! Thank you Lupron.",10,1
Lupron,"Lupron Depot 11.25mg 3 month suspension has given me my life back. I have been on this for a month and saw my doctor today. His first words were wow! It is shrinking my huge fibroids. I had constant bleeding with flooding every month. Finally Sept 8th, 2010 I hemorrhaged. I was admitted into the hospital unconscious. Thank God my husband had the presence of mind not to sign a consent form for an emergency hysterectomy. I spot rarely now and have lost 4 pant sizes because the fibroids have shrunk so much. I will take my second shot on Jan 4th, 2011 and hope it will put me in permanent menopause. I am 49 and will avoid surgery at all costs. My side effects have been mild at best. My experience has been fantastic so far.",10,1
Lupron,"I was so skeptical about these shots, scared to death of the side effects after reading posts...I could kick myself! My shirts fall past my waist, I always looked pregnant. Slight headache, took generic aspirin, did the trick, hot flashes, weird but no that bad. Cycle, had one regular (heavy) period then skipped. 
Overall, I was so satisfied, I just called and ordered my second shot (I get them quarterly).
Everyone reacts different to different types of medication...what works for others may not work for you but this did work for me.
Good Luck...Sorry for the grammer stuff was in a rush",10,1
Lupron,"My rating is based SOLELY on symptoms, I am unsure about the effectiveness being that I haven't checked my fibroid size yet to see if it has suppressed. To furthermore explain, I was diagnosed with a large fibroid about 10cm (outside my uterus) through a CT scan. I'm 28, no children, but hoping to conceive in my early 30s, therefore I chose to go on with the Lupron shot (3.75) to hopefully shrink the fibroid for surgery early next year. After reading the side effects, I was terrified and put this off for a year and a half. I have had ONE symptom and that is I do notice that my  (face) is a bit clammy/dry. Just wishing I never put it off due to fear. I just finished my first month. Will update how month 2 went in January!",10,1
Lupron,"I had a fibroid that had grown into my uterine cavity and it caused heavy bleeding, large blood clots, and discomfort.  I had surgery scheduled in June of 2016 and was given a Lupron injection in March of 2016 to shrink the fibroid to make surgery easier.  I had read terrible reviews and was scared of the side effects.  Overall my experience was very positive, I had minor side effects such as hot flashes and migraines.  I am in my mid-twenties and very active, which I believe helped.  No weight gain or hair loss.  I felt great throughout the 3 months and actually felt more mentally and hormonally balanced then ever before...I'm actually kind of upset it has worn off!  Don't be afraid of this drug, it worked wonders for me!",10,1
Lupron,"Awesome stuff!  I went on Lupron so I could be a candidate for focused ultrasound treatment.  Don't let all the negative reviews scare you!  I used to look about 4 months pregnant.  I am otherwise healthy, thin and exercise regularly.  Had minor hot flashes; not a big deal considering the overall benefits.  My mass of fibroids shrank dramatically in 3 months. Previously hard, round abdominal area shrank considerably!  I couldn't believe how successful Lupron was for me, and how good I felt on it.  I went off the pill (which I was on for years for constant bleeding/spotting).  Didn't have memory loss, hair loss or bad moods like many other women's experiences.  I took vitamins while on it to help counteract things like possible bone loss.",10,1
Lupron,I had extremely painful periods and constant bleeding. My doctor started me on the shot in Jan. and had second one in March. Best thing I ever did. No bleeding after 1st month and no pain after the 2nd month. Side effects were in my opinion mild. Worst were the hot flashes but in my opinion worth it. Doctor only wanted me to have to 2 shots so after June going to see what happens. I don't want to get on any birth control so will see what happens. I'm really hoping this makes it all better.,10,1
Lupron,"I was bleeding 24/7 and anemic due to a large fibroid.  First I tried Depo Provera shots, which didn't work.  All bleeding stopped about a week and a half after my first Lupron shot.  At this point, it's only been a month, so I don't know if I'll still need a hysterectomy. ",10,1
Lupron,"I have been on lupron for 3 years. I began the shot in 2013 with a 11 cm fibroid too large for surgery at time. I am now in my late 50's and still testing positive on hormon tests. another words if I go off lupron I a assuming the fibroid will grow again and I will begin again to menstruated and have heavy bleed and large clots.  my headaches became much less and only have hotflashes towards the end of my 3 month shot. I get shots quarterly. my bone density was just shy from normal with no concerns for many years. I take calcium, D3 and K2 (MK7-helps make calcium go to bone not soft tissue like calcification and bone spurs ).  
for me is has been the best thing in my life.  I can't imagine why people have bad results. oh and no weight gain.",10,1
Lupron,"Finally, something that worked for my fibroids! Yay",9,1
Lupron,"I was having very heavy periods due to fibroids. My Gyn gave me the shot and it was amazing! No more periods! the trade off I took was night sweats and early onset menopause, but after such heavy bleeding that I have very low blood count, anemia and vitamin D deffieciency, it was well worth it! I'm only in the last few weeks of my first shot, but I can't wait for the next one!",9,1
Lupron,"I started taking Lupron in November, 2014, and I am currently still taking the shots. I have had almost no side effects except for occasional hot flashes. I was put on Lupron because of heavy bleeding, due to my large fibroids. I am extremely happy with the results. My fibroids have shrunk to the point that I can now have a laparoscopic hysterectomy, rather than the old fashion full abdominal surgery. I haven't had a menstrual cycle in 9 months.",9,1
Lupron,"I have had like 8 fibroids super big  started 2015 March started bleeding blood clots. I was close to 50 years old so I found a study and she recommended lupron, I'm not gonna lie had 3 shots, my hair fell out - its gone, but for the pain I'm in right now might have to get my 4th shot.  This situation changes your life style 100%. Horrible uterus pain is unbelievable. 
 My hot flash/ cold flash worst are without lupron.",9,1
Lupron,I had to get the 3 month Lupron Depot shot to help shrink my uterine fibroid and to help minimize the bleeding before surgery. After reading all the reviews on the shot I was very scared to get it but I am now going into my third month on the shot with minimal side effects. My doctor did recommend that I continue my birth control pills while on the shot to help add a little estrogen back into my system. I'm not sure if that's what help me with the side effects. All in all everyone's body reacts differently.,9,1
Lupron,"I didn't experience any major problems, except some mild stomach cramping initially and continued heavy bleeding for the first two injections. By my 3rd shot, just mild spotting and occasional cramping. I jut finished my 4th round, still no hot flashes, etc. I'm actually looking forward for my upcoming surgery soon.",8,1
Lupron,"Side effects experienced from 3-month shot: hot flashes, night sweats, fatigue, cognitive ""fuzziness"", decreased memory. I experienced a significant temporary reduction in fibroid size/abdomen size (pre-surgery).",8,1
Lupron,"I love that it completely stopped my outrageous heavy bleeding, which in turn made me anemic.  So I am happy for that.  However, the only side effect that I am experiencing is super dry skin on my arms, neck and face...I feel it is aging me overnight.  Some constipation, and not really hot flashes but warm spells every now and then.  Can't wait for surgery to get my hormones back to work.",8,1
Lupron,"I believe having this injection and educating yourself on the side effects goes hand in hand. I knew it could cause depletion of bones, I doubled up on calcium. I knew it would throw me into menopause, I immediately and consistently took black cohash. I had a hemoglobin of 6.5. It stopped my heavy periods which allowed it to rise to 12 in order to not have to have a transfusion during or after my hysterectomy. Educate yourself and prepare your body for the injection. The injection can not do all of the work, nor should you expect to.",8,1
Lupron,"I wanted to write a review for other omen who are thinking about getting this injection. I read a lot of horror stories online so I was pretty nervous. I got the 3 month injection to try and shrink my large fibroids.

Upshot is, it wasn't that bad but my fibroids didn't shrink; however, it stopped my periods. Preventing the excessive bleeding is good for health prior to hysterectomy. But it's expensive and insurance will make you jump through bureaucratic hoops to get it.

After getting the shot, I felt kind of weird. Then I had one last awful period blowout a few days later. Since then, no periods.

Menopause symptoms included hot flashes, brain fog, mild acne, some moodiness and irritability. However I think a lot of this can be worked around with good nutrition, exercise, breathable clothing, meditation.",8,1
Lupron,"I am 28 with a 21cm x 13cm uterine fibroid. 
I was told me surgery would be risky and would leave me with a scar from under my chest to my pelvic area, since I am only 28 and would like to have children of my own they decided to put me on Lupron for 6 months to shrink the fibroid by hopefully 50% and have a much smaller and less risky surgery. 
Went on the shot in June, with the first month being the hardest, with headaches, night sweats, hot flashes and my first period being very heavy and lots of clots. But I am on my 2 shot month 2.5 months in and I can say most of those symptoms went away, I only get hot flashes which are definitely bearable.",8,1
Lupron,Hot flashes throughout the day; moodiness and moderate depression and moderate fatigue.,7,1
Lupron,"1) Total loss of libido and sexual function within the first month-persisting for several months post-treatment; 2) Shrinkage of testicles and penis; 3) Breast growth; 4) Brutal hot flashes (2-3 times per hour, 24/7, as if your internal thermostat has gone haywire--lasting for another four months post-treatment; 4) Liver damage (GGT spiked to double upper limit w/o alcohol intake--slowly recovering with aid of milk thistle); 5) Cholesterol spiked 50% under same diet and daily exercise--slowly normalizing; 6) Onset of anemia with careful diet and daily exercise--slowly normalizing; 7) Vision impairment; 8) Sudden onset of fatigue--as if I suddenly could not stay awake for one more mile while driving home; 9) Much slower beard growth and loss of body hair; 10) Poor sleep at night and general lethargy during the day; 11) Weight gain (+10-15 lbs) under similar diet and regular exercise, which has been very difficult to lose since the last shot timed-out a year ago. This is a powerful drug that should be used only under full disclosure and with regular monitoring. Suggest doing a lab assessment every 3 months and being under the care of a good endocrinologist.",6,1
Lupron,"At 40 years old, I have suffered endometreosis for 25 years; severe enough to miss work every month when my period started. Symptoms were surpressed in early years by birth control bills and depo prevara shots (at different times); both of which helped. Due to a clotting disorder discovered in early 30's, I can not take hormone related treatments any longer. My gyn doctor suggested Lupron. I'm on month 4 of the 6 month treatment. I feel fabulous!! With the exception of hot flashes (about 10 / day), I experience no side effects. The hot flashes, which my doctor told me to except as the #1 side effect, are nothing compared to what I was experiencing every month. And I have no periods!! And no pain. And much, much more energy. I wish I would have tried this years ago. Have not decided the course of treatment afterwards (suggested to get ablasia). But for now, enjoying life!",10,1
Lupron,Lost all sex drive and became impotent while taking it. When you have no desire for sex not being able to perform is not a problem. I regained a much reduced but satisfactory libido and function after three months off it. In other words I can get a weak erection if I want to but it no longer is the primary factor in my life. My orgasms are dry but as I no longer have a prostrate this is to be expected. I had prostrate cancer at forty years of age. I am fifteen years cancer free and every day is a blessing. Living with a reduced sexual function is preferable than being a corpse with a rock hard erction,9.5,1
Lupron,"Used 18 years ago after surgery for endometriosis. I had no side affects except missing my period. It did it's job, and I was later able to have two children. The only thing I did not like about it was monthly doctor's visits, and the fact that it is a intermuscular shot...but I HATE shots. I would definately recommend this treatment if needed, but my doctor was careful, because osteoporosis runs in my family, he said I could never use for more than six months (which is how long we did it) in my lifetime.",9.5,1
Lupron,"Received 3-month shot two weeks ago to stop heavy menstrual bleeding in preparation for a hysterectomy next month. My period started and the bleeding is just as extreme as usual. No relief in blood or pain with this drug. Have experience hot flashes (minor), headaches (minor), night sweats, nausea (moderate), and have pain in upper right back area. Will be seeing doctor later this week to get checked on. I know it's early in the process, but I'm disappointed. I took it knowing about the side effects, but was willing to go along with them to get my bleeding under control and to build up my iron stores.",1,0
Lupron,"I was given 7 monthly injections of Lupron, given to me at my PCP's office each month.  This was done for the fibroids I had and for the fact that I was on a plan to have an entire hysterectomy at the end of that 7 months. I bled very little really, but overall thats about the best thing I can say about that drug

After every injection I was an emotional basketcase before I could even get back to my car from the doctors office--emotional to the hilt.   I'd go home and then...become lost in my own surroundings in my own home.  I would not recommend anyone who's planning on having a hysterectomy to use this 'pre-surgery' drug. Ever.  I mean, its hard enough to have to get a hysterectomy to begin with, then make it harder on yourself?",1,0
Lupron,This medicine has given me horrible headaches. Lost a lot of hair gained weight  insomnia.,1,0
Lupron,"My experience was horrible. My Obgyn recommended lupron for my fibroids. I have 1 large one  the size of grapefruit, 3 the size of tennis balls and many pea size. Surgery not an option. I get lupron shots 1 time a month for 6 months. I had 13 acne cysts in total on my face that I had to have sugerically removed (over time). I gained 30 pounds almost overnight and it took me 3 years of intense dieting to get this weight off. My body thought I was going thru menopause so I had the hot flashes as well. I would not do it again. I spent a fortune only to find out after 6 months and all of this that the tumors were the same size. Years later I am having health issues and wondering if related to lupron usage.",1,0
Lupron,It cause me permanent hair loss.,1,0
Lupron,"I had very heavy periods. My doctor offered lupron shot.  I decided to go with 2 lupron shots hopping it would shrink my fibroid.  Instead, my fibroid grew bigger.  It caused me horrible headaches with strongest pain killers not helping.  After each shot my period would not stop for a month (at least it was not heavy).  Hot flushes were horrible.  Good night sleep was gone.  I would wake up multiple times a night all drenched in sweat.  After effect of lupron wore out and my period re-started it was as heavy as before.  The only benefit I got was not having a period for few months (with some bleeding in between), but at a very high price (side effects and actual price).  I think as heavy as my period was it was better to have my period  for few days a month, than having frequent very bad headaches and constant hot flashes.   I would not recommend it based on my experience.  I would not have it done if I would have to decide today.",1,0
Lupron,"Had a large pedunctulated fibroid tumor on my uterus- shot was administered , they found my fibroid got larger after 3 months. Had to have a partial hysterectomy to have it removed so I could sit, drive and have sex without being uncomfortable or bleeding.  I had every side effect which was miserable. I had extreme hair loss (thinning) and I'm still trying to grow it back... this drug did not work for me. It has been over a year.",1,0
Lupron,"This drug was the worse form of treatment for my multiple symptoms - Daytime hot flashes and steady period was not worth it.

Headaches, blurred vision; quick weight gain and most of all I quit my job and I'm still try'n to figure out why when I was financially stable. Who was I?  Something in my brain is out of sync, I was not a person that took medicines.

Do still have my ovaries. I’m still getting hot flashes. I have a headache every day  of different levels. The nausea almost went away. Hot flashes are worse at night so I’m losing a lot of sleep.  The last three weeks my legs are aching every day when I get up. I have no desire to have sex.  This is definitely miserable.

Lupron,"I had my first Lupron shot on August 10, 2012.  I started bleeding August 21, and it is now September 29 and have been bleeding ever since.  I've had a problem with anemia due to two fibroids.  I had my second Lupron shot on September 10.

Lupron,I have been taking the Lupron shot for fibroids. I was bleeding so heavy I was wearing diapers could not wear pads anymore when I suffered my 6th stroke I told my doc look you are not putting me on any blood thinner suntil you fix the problem down there.  The first shot I bled afterward for like 3 days. But not as heavy as I normally would. My next shot is in July 2018. The first time I took the shot I had mood swings hot flashes at night headache and sleeplessness.  It takes you on a journey but my fibroids are shrinking tremendously. The newest side effect I discovered is swollen gums.  No fun. Do what you can to preserve your smile while taking this drug or you can lose your teeth.  I used to have a beautiful smile now that is gone.  The only drawback I have.,5,1
Lupron,"I am on a 3 month shot plan but monthly shots. I didn't want the 3 month all at once because I wanted to see how my body would react to it first.
Shot given 12/07/16 and today is 12/28/16. The first week, I didnt really have any side effects and I was really hopeful that this will be the worse. Wishful thinking didnt last long. Hot flashes, night sweats, chills, emotional wreck and I believe slight headaches that come and go.
BUT on the contrary, less than a month and my fibroid has already physically shrank. I havent seen the doc yet but I can physically see that it shrank. My clothes are loose in the belt line area. My fibroid was the size of a small grapefruit (17cm) but I really see a huge different in shrinkage.
Could be worse :/",5,1
Lupron,"I had the 3 month 11.25mg on 3/30/2015 to shrink my giant fibroid to the size that the laparoscopic myomectomy can be performed. I had no symptom of side effects for the first month and also having my period but ever since the second month (May) the side effects were really hitting me hard; including hot flashes and night sweat. Had my surgery at the end of June and my doctor confirmed that I had reacted to the Lupron more thanexpected as the fibroid not only shrink but part of it was degenerated. So Instead of a 2 hours operation, it ends up to be a 6 hours.  Now, it's been 5 months and the Lupron still lasting (period still not back yet), don't know when it will be gone.",5,1

I am experiencing a lot hot flashes through out the day and at night they last a few minutes. No night sweats. My body, but mainly my legs ache and feel tingly/numb. Restless nights, having trouble staying asleep. My hair is now very dry and brittle and hair loss. (It was healthy before). Vaginal dryness. Memory problems, trouble focusing. I am forgetting a lot of things. Major mood swings, from very angry to crying. Increased appetite (carb craving). I hope all this is worth it at the end. None of these side effects are unbearable but I definitely do not feel myself. Round 2 coming up 10/22/2019.",6,1
Lupron,Received one shot for three full months. Nearing the end . Major side effects were the hot flashes and some weird feeling of uneasiness. I would not take it again. Hot flashes are not cool.

Lupron,"I am 52 (5'8"", 155 lbs) w/ large (13 cm) intramural fibroid (fibroid w/in the muscle wall of the uterus).   In case I had any adverse reaction to Lupron, decided to take the low dose injection (1 x a month) instead of the single high dose that lasts three months.  Felt pretty okay w/ Lupron, other than a dull headache that lingered on for two months (I only had two injections).  The actual fibroid did not shrink much after two months (from 13 to 11 cm) but the surgeon said it made the fibroid softer.  Had a laparoscopic hysterectomy w/ success.  90% recovered after five days.",6,1
Lupron,"Please Google Lupton Petition and look for the PETITION TO CONGRESS link. Click on it, you do not have to sign petition (although doing so would be greatly appreciated) and scroll down and read all the dreadful testimonies from men and women. Please stay away from this drug.",2,0

Lupron,Loss of Sexual desire (very hard on spouse)! Unable to perform at all sexually PSA has risen significantly after 2.5 to 3 years! Caused my transplanted KIDNEY to REJECT immediately! Life changing event!,2,0
Lupron,"Lupron was the absolute worse choice I ever made. It has wrecked havoc on my body, brain and health for the past 25+years. Doctors now little more about it now than they did then and they still tell patients NOTHING! It's horrifying!!! This drug caused me to have a stroke. It stops you from producing ALL pituitary hormones..not just estrogen/progesterone...ALL HORMONES, Neurotransmitters and essential Amino Acids...ALL are stopped when Lupron is injected. Our body and brain do NOT function correctly without these!!! Bad things are bound to happen to anyone who takes this drug!!! It changes you, your chemistry, the parts don't fit back together just because Lupron has stopped being injected...the damage is permenant. That's what no doctor will tell you...Because the drug reps don't tell them.... Learn all you can before you put this into your body or your childs body!",2,0
Lupron,"Severe side effects, especially with insomnia and mood. Didn’t get more than 4 hours of sleep a night for 6 months, caused Severe Anxiety, and triggered Severe Mania with Psychosis (delusional). I do have Bipolar Disorder which has been well-managed for over a decade, but the Lupron triggered the mania in such a rapid and intense manner, medication wasn’t working to combat despite adding an atypical antipsychotic and increasing dosage weekly. Still ended up in hospital psychiatric unit and had to be readmitted 48 hrs after first discharge for same reason. Went through 2 other antipsychotics before getting it under control. They need to make warnings about theses side effects much more prominent. I’m now going to be have an Oophorectomy instead, so I can take aromatase inhibitor still.",2,0
Ulipristal,"If I could give a rating of 0, I would. I had very heavy bleeding from fibroid. It was supposed to slow down bleeding and shrink fibroid. This drug made it worse. And the fibroid did not shrink. Terrible experience.",1,0

Ulipristal,My OBGYN prescribed this med for my heavy periods I've been suffering with since I had a tubal ligation in 2007.   I have just completed my first cycle and I pleased to say I FINALLY HAVE A LIGHT TO REGULAR FLOW PERIOD. THANK YOU FOR THIS MED..LIFE SAVER!,10,1

Traxemic acid,To the point I was flooding a super tampon in less than an hour and it was like a tap with clots the size of 50p. I have taken once month last month. 3 days  two tabs 3 times p/d. This month I have to take them but now I am 8 days late on my period. I already have fertility problems and had my left tube taken out 3years ago for the best interest of my health. I am 32 and  had two long term relationships. I've never used contraception with my 2 partners and have never conceived. I am awaiting further diagnosis from my gynaecologist. Just wondering has anyone else's cycle stopped completely taking these tablets?,10,1
Traxemic acid,"I used to have super heavy periods, where even standing up would be an issue (now have bloodstains all around the house from leaking) and I would leak through super plus tampon and super night pad together after just an hour, now my period is 'normal' I wouldn't call it light cause it's still not light I think but it's just normal like other people's periods and I think it is FAB! and I would recommend this to any fellow lady with crazy mental periods because I've not leaked since! wooooo ((however cramps have slightly worsened))",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I love this medication. I bleed super heavy during my cycle. A pad and tampon will last for an hour at most. My doctor wants to do ablation surgery, but I wanted to try the medicine first. It really reduced the bleeding, but my periods went from 9 days to 13.  However, they are light days so I'm happy. For the first 4 months I got a headache with each dose, but now that has gone away.",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I have fibroids and my periods reflects this with large clots, blood pouring into toilet, soaking super size tampon in 25 minutes and severe cramps. Took this medication as prescribed, (2 tablets every 8 hours up to five days) and by dose 3, my period gets manageable. I use Tynol Extra Strength for my cramping pain because Advil is a blood thinner and it works good. I can go 2 hours with a super size tampon now and the extreme heavy bleeding is down to a ""normal"" heavy period. I'd say it reduced bleeding by 40 to 50 %. Instead of 5 or 6 days of bleeding heavy, it's 3 days of "" normal"" heavy and 6 days in total of menstruation. Ladies I recommend giving this a go if you also have severe heavy periods. Mild headache as side effect but it is tummy friendly and I have my life back during my periods.",10,1
Traxemic acid,This medicine is a blessing  I am 43 years old I eat healthy and exercise everyday except weekends. On March 15 2017 I was given the depot shot for my heavy bleeding BIG MISTAKE. From the shot I experience more bleeding and blood clots then I ever experience prior to me taking the shot. My bleeding continued for over 90 days I was admitted to the hospital for low blood and had to have a 4 pints of blood transfusion.  On  July 4 my doctor prescribed Lysteda I did experience some cramping and back pain but after 5 days of taking this medicine 3 times a day my bleeding stop completely now husband and I are much happier people!!,10,1
Traxemic acid,Where has this been all my life?  My cycles were really heavy.  I would use an ultra tampon and have an overnight pad on as well.  I would go to the bathroom every hour.  Now I can go every 3-4 hours.  I don't have to worry about getting up in the middle of the night changing pads.  Now I can move on with life and don't have to worry about going somewhere on cycle days.,10,1

The bleeding and clotting sending me to the bathroom every 30-45 mins has stopped, no more getting up in the middle of the night or changing the sheets at 4am and I've been very lucky with no side effects. 6 pills a day is a lot but considering the alternative of unstoppable bleeding, I happily take them.

I also experience debilitating cramps and became severely anemic from the heavy bleeding.  This is my first month on Lysteda.  I just completed my third day of treatment, and this is the first normal period I have had in years - no diapers and no cramping whatsoever!  My flow was so light that I only had to change my pad a few times on the heaviest day, and had no need for tampons.  I highly recommend Lysteda.",10,1

Traxemic acid,"I used to have super heavy periods, where even standing up would be an issue (now have bloodstains all around the house from leaking) and I would leak through super plus tampon and super night pad together after just an hour, now my period is 'normal' I wouldn't call it light cause it's still not light I think but it's just normal like other people's periods and I think it is FAB! and I would recommend this to any fellow lady with crazy mental periods because I've not leaked since! wooooo ((however cramps have slightly worsened))",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I love this medication. I bleed super heavy during my cycle. A pad and tampon will last for an hour at most. My doctor wants to do ablation surgery, but I wanted to try the medicine first. It really reduced the bleeding, but my periods went from 9 days to 13.  However, they are light days so I'm happy. For the first 4 months I got a headache with each dose, but now that has gone away.",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I have fibroids and my periods reflects this with large clots, blood pouring into toilet, soaking super size tampon in 25 minutes and severe cramps. Took this medication as prescribed, (2 tablets every 8 hours up to five days) and by dose 3, my period gets manageable. I use Tynol Extra Strength for my cramping pain because Advil is a blood thinner and it works good. I can go 2 hours with a super size tampon now and the extreme heavy bleeding is down to a ""normal"" heavy period. I'd say it reduced bleeding by 40 to 50 %. Instead of 5 or 6 days of bleeding heavy, it's 3 days of "" normal"" heavy and 6 days in total of menstruation. Ladies I recommend giving this a go if you also have severe heavy periods. Mild headache as side effect but it is tummy friendly and I have my life back during my periods.",10,1
Traxemic acid,This medicine is a blessing  I am 43 years old I eat healthy and exercise everyday except weekends. On March 15 2017 I was given the depot shot for my heavy bleeding BIG MISTAKE. From the shot I experience more bleeding and blood clots then I ever experience prior to me taking the shot. My bleeding continued for over 90 days I was admitted to the hospital for low blood and had to have a 4 pints of blood transfusion.  On  July 4 my doctor prescribed Lysteda I did experience some cramping and back pain but after 5 days of taking this medicine 3 times a day my bleeding stop completely now husband and I are much happier people!!,10,1
Traxemic acid,Where has this been all my life?  My cycles were really heavy.  I would use an ultra tampon and have an overnight pad on as well.  I would go to the bathroom every hour.  Now I can go every 3-4 hours.  I don't have to worry about getting up in the middle of the night changing pads.  Now I can move on with life and don't have to worry about going somewhere on cycle days.,10,1
Traxemic acid,"Tranexamic acid stops my heavy bleeding I take it 3 times a day and I  take it only one day and it stops my bleeding otherwise my bleeding never stops not even any birth control pills help.

The bleeding and clotting sending me to the bathroom every 30-45 mins has stopped, no more getting up in the middle of the night or changing the sheets at 4am and I've been very lucky with no side effects. 6 pills a day is a lot but considering the alternative of unstoppable bleeding, I happily take them.  It's not a total miracle, I still have ""heavy"" days those would've been a good day for me in the past.  It's worth it, I'm very happy with it.",10,1

I also experience debilitating cramps and became severely anemic from the heavy bleeding.  This is my first month on Lysteda.  I just completed my third day of treatment, and this is the first normal period I have had in years - no diapers and no cramping whatsoever!

Traxemic acid,My periods were getting worse. To the point I was flooding a super tampon in less than an hour and it was like a tap with clots the size of 50p. I have taken once month last month. 3 days  two tabs 3 times p/d. This month I have to take them but now I am 8 days late on my period. I already have fertility problems and had my left tube taken out 3years ago for the best interest of my health. I am 32 and  had two long term relationships.

If you bleed to death every month, get these tablets!",10,1
Traxemic acid,"Lysteda is amazing.  I have menorrhagia caused by adenomyosis.  I have dealt with disablingly heavy periods for nearly 10 years.  I usually take two days off from work and wear diapers for the first two days of my period, waking up several times throughout the night to change.  I also experience debilitating cramps and became severely anemic from the heavy bleeding.  This is my first month on Lysteda.  I just completed my third day of treatment, and this is the first normal period I have had in years - no diapers and no cramping whatsoever!  My flow was so light that I only had to change my pad a few times on the heaviest day, and had no need for tampons.  I highly recommend Lysteda.",10,1
Traxemic acid,Please be sure not to always trust advice given by a general pract. I begun taking the medication as I suffered heavy periods. I have now no periods . I have now severe health problem as my ovaries are effected from the medication . Also causing slowing and muscular problems speech and trouble thinking . Also tiredness most times not wanting to wake up. I am thankfully a mother but I did not think this could effect my chance in the  future for more children.  It completely stopped my periods and ruined my hormone levels. My count is so bad the effects are scary. Cyst have been a major cause of stomach pain and depression .,10,1
Traxemic acid,This is a terrific medication for me. I take it for excessively heavy monthly periods. Normally they are so heavy I can't leave the house for a day or two. This really has helped me to deal with the problem without taking hormones or having to have a hysterectomy. I have had no side effects whatsoever and find it very tolerable.,10,1

Traxemic acid,"Tranexamic acid stops my heavy bleeding I take it 3 times a day and I  take it only one day and it stops my bleeding otherwise my bleeding never stops not even any birth control pills help.
It stops my bleeding so I am happy to use it.
But take original brand as the 
generic never help me",10,1
Traxemic acid,"I've been on Lysteda for 6 months and it really has saved my sanity. I didn't want to jump the gun with a review as I've had birth control pills work for a month or 2 then suddenly my period would come back as bad, if not worse, and lasted once for 41 days! The bleeding and clotting sending me to the bathroom every 30-45 mins has stopped, no more getting up in the middle of the night or changing the sheets at 4am and I've been very lucky with no side effects. 6 pills a day is a lot but considering the alternative of unstoppable bleeding, I happily take them.  It's not a total miracle, I still have ""heavy"" days those would've been a good day for me in the past.  It's worth it, I'm very happy with it.",10,1

It's not a total miracle, I still have ""heavy"" days those would've been a good day for me in the past.  It's worth it, I'm very happy with it.",10,1
Traxemic acid,Works very well for heavy bleeding during menstrual cycle,10,1
Traxemic acid,"I have 20  large fibroids that have come back after two my surgeries. I have just started taking these tablets and what a huge difference it has made to my life. I can now leave the house and no more flooding. I can sleep though the night without getting up multiple times to change. No more large clots. If you bleed to death every month, get these tablets!",10,1
Traxemic acid,"Lysteda is amazing.  I have menorrhagia caused by adenomyosis.  I have dealt with disablingly heavy periods for nearly 10 years.  I usually take two days off from work and wear diapers for the first two days of my period, waking up several times throughout the night to change.  I also experience debilitating cramps and became severely anemic from the heavy bleeding.  This is my first month on Lysteda.  I just completed my third day of treatment, and this is the first normal period I have had in years - no diapers and no cramping whatsoever!  My flow was so light that I only had to change my pad a few times on the heaviest day, and had no need for tampons.  I highly recommend Lysteda.",10,1
Traxemic acid,Please be sure not to always trust advice given by a general pract. I begun taking the medication as I suffered heavy periods. I have now no periods . I have now severe health problem as my ovaries are effected from the medication . Also causing slowing and muscular problems speech and trouble thinking . Also tiredness most times not wanting to wake up. I am thankfully a mother but I did not think this could effect my chance in the  future for more children.  It completely stopped my periods and ruined my hormone levels. My count is so bad the effects are scary. Cyst have been a major cause of stomach pain and depression .,10,1
Traxemic acid,This is a terrific medication for me. I take it for excessively heavy monthly periods. Normally they are so heavy I can't leave the house for a day or two. This really has helped me to deal with the problem without taking hormones or having to have a hysterectomy. I have had no side effects whatsoever and find it very tolerable.,10,1
